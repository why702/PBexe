/**
 * The multi-template enrollment controller drives the enrollment
 * process by taking several image captures representing the same
 * finger and creates a multi-template representation of it. While
 * the main target for mult-templates is small sensors it can be used
 * for any sensor.
 *
 * The controller can be used in two different ways:
 *
 *  - Fully automated  - see pb_multitemplate_enroll()
 *  - Image driven     - see pb_multitemplate_enroll_create()
 *
 * The fully automated mode requires a full BMF integration with
 * a sensor driver/reader object, database etc. In this mode the
 * controller is just started and will continue to capture image
 * samples until the enrollment process is competed.
 *
 * The image driven mode expects image capture, quality and area
 * screening to be done outside of the controller. Hence it does
 * not require a full BMF integration. In this mode no screening
 * of samples of poor quality or small area is done, this should
 * be handled by the capturing logic.
 *
 * In both modes there is a GUI feedback interface that will
 * receive events and data that should be presented to the user
 * to drive the enrollment. Both visual and textual data exist.
 *
 * In the image driven mode events regarding the image capturing
 * process will not be given (such as place/lift finger and display
 * image quality).
 *
 * A configuration is used to configure the enrollment process,
 * like max number of captures to make. The fully automated mode
 * relies on more parameters than the image driven as these are
 * needed to control the capturing part.

/** Image driven multitemplate enrollment.
  *
  * For embedded systems the image driven version is typically the easiest
  * to integrate as the image capture process is not integrated. Instead
  * images are pushed to the controller as they are captured. The capture
  * logic will however be responsible of area and quality of samples.
  * In this scenario the configuration parameters for capture is
  * not relevant to the controller.
  *
  * There are two main versions of the controller.
  *
  *  MPU - The most advanced and suited for MPU environments with a bit
  *        more resources. The controller supports rich user feedback,
  *        template selection and creates templates that can be
  *        continuously updated.
  *
  *  MCU - A simpler controller using less resources and suited for MCU
  *        environments. Still provides some user feedback and template
  *        selections. Creates templates that allows incremental update
  *        until max capacity is reached.
  *
  * To run an image driven multitemplate enrollment, follow these steps:
  *     1. Create a pb_multitemplate_enroll_t object
  *             pb_multitemplate_enroll_t* mte = pb_multitemplate_enroll_create (...);
  *     2. Continously push images to the mte object until all captures have
  *        been collected.
  *             pb_multitemplate_enroll_run (mte, image, 0, &coverage);
  *        The _run function returns the coverage of a thought area (250x350) of
  *        the merged fingerprint.
  *     3. When all captures have been collected, call pb_multitemplate_finalize_template
  *        to start the process of choosing which templates to store in the
  *        multitemplate. Returns the enrolled multitemplate.
  *     4. Delete the mte object
  *             pb_multitemplate_enroll_delete (mte);
  *
  * When running this type of enrollment, more responsibility is put on the
  * caller. E.g. the caller needs to ensure that the pushed images really
  * contains a fingerprint of a certain quality and area. Further, the caller is
  * responsible for storing the multitemplate.

  * Some differences compared to the fully featured controller:
  *
  *   - gui is optional, may be null.
  *   - can be configured to limit number of checks against accepted
  *     samples, default is all but may be lowered when CPU speed requires it.
  *   - prevent multiple fingers setting is a bit more strict; it will reject
  *     samples that do not match with any of the already enrolled samples.
  *   - creates a more limited but to some extent more practical template format
  *     that can be incrementally updated until max capacity is reached. Max
  *     capacity is either max number of subtemplates or max template size.
  *     Can be configured to use continuous update templates.
  *   - the incremental nature of the template update allows update in Flash
  *     without erase (typically).
  *   - may limit max_nbr_captures if max template size is reached first,
  *     there is no point in collecting more than this many samples with current
  *     implementation (may change in future). In this case enrollment may end with
  *     PB_RC_CAPACITY, while not an error a reconfig may be relevant.
  *   - will not not give synthetic_image or display_island feedback
  *   - will not give calculate image coverage, 0 reported until last then 100.
  *   - will give basic feedback of required finger movements
  *   - will reject too similar samples, as tuned by the limit in number of
  *     verifications done.
