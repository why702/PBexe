/**
 * This file declares types and functions used to handle timestamps and
 * difference in wall time between two timestamps (occations in time). 
 * 
 * Since high resolution measurement of wall time is not handled by ANSI C, 
 * platform specific implementations are possible. What implementation is 
 * used is controlled by defines, e.g. PB_USE_ANSI_C_TIME and 
 * PB_USE_POSIX_TIME which are implemented in pb_timestamp.c. You should 
 * include pb_timestamp.c in your project even if not using any of these 
 * implementations since it contains also some platform independent function
 * definitions.
 *
 * The following implementations are included (identified by corresponding
 * define that must be set when building):
 * 
 * - PB_USE_ANSI_C_TIME
 *
 *   The time() function of ANSI C allows 1s resolution only.
 *   If that is sufficient, this implementation can be used on most platforms.
 *   NOTE: The clock() function of ANSI C gives the processor time and not
 *         wall time. So although this clock often offers better resolution,
 *         it's not suitable in this context.
 *
 * - PB_USE_POSIX_TIME
 *
 *   Only avaliable on POSIX compliant platforms. A good choice if available. 
 *
 * - PB_USE_WIN_SYSTEM_TIME
 *
 *   Uses the GetTickCount () Windows function, that returns elapsed
 *   milliseconds in a 32bit value sice the system was started. The resolution
 *   is limited to the resolution of the system timer, which is typically in 
 *   the range of 10 milliseconds to 16 milliseconds.
 *
 *   Note! The timer will wrap after 49,7 days, but this is taking care of by
 *   the pb_timestamp_diff_x functions.
