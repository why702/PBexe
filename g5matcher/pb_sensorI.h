/// The sensor interface
/** The sensor interface allows different sensors to be implemented.
  * 
  * A system may have one ore more sensor implementations. Each implementation 
  * handles one or more types of sensors.
  * 
  * The sensors handled by one implementation is handled via the sensor 
  * interface but also via the common reader object (pb_reader_t).
  * 
  * While the reader object is used for the process of capturing images the 
  * sensor interface is used to initilize the sensors and act as a factory to 
  * create reader objects.
  * 
  * Since the reader object itself does not know how to implement the capture of 
  * images for various images, each created reader object must delegate this to 
  * the corresponding sensor implementation. This is managed via the 
  * pb_reader_create() function specifying the implementation of 
  * pb_reader_captureI interface to be used for each reader.
  * 
  * Since each sensor implementation is responsible for creating the reader 
  * objects they can pass in the corresponding functions for the capture 
  * functions. This way a reader object abstracts the details of the capturing 
  * process.
  * 
  * This means that a typical sensor implementation needs to implement both this 
  * interface and the pb_reader_captureI interface.
  *
  * Sensor session
  *
  * A sensor implementation remains completely idle until it is started in what 
  * is called a sensor session. During a sensor session the sensor 
  * implementation will be able to list and manage sensors and the corresponding 
  * reader objects, discover new and detached sensors etc.
  * 
  * At the end of a sensor session all resources are released and this also 
  * means that any created reader objects are unusable (calling any methods on 
  * a released reader will result in an error code).
  * 
  * A session may last for a long time, possible throughout the lifecycle of the 
  * running application. During this period new readers may be connected and can 
  * be discovered by listing readers again or by using the plug and play 
  * notification. Readers may also be disconnected and reconnected during the 
  * session. Reconnected readers can be identified via the unique reader id, 
  * retrieved by calling pb_reader_get_id.
  * 
  * It is not required to actually implement the plug and play support in a 
  * sensor implementation, e.g. if there only is one fixed sensor in an
  * embedded system there is no point in such a function.
